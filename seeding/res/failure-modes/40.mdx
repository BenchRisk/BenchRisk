short: Different demographic groups (cultural, professional, educational, etc.) viewing
  the benchmark have different interpretations of the information conveyed
example: A benchmark is produced by the American Bar Association detailing the legal
  appropriateness of a legal aid chatbot. A user that has not encountered lawyers
  before sees that all chatbots score poorly and believes the technology to be completely
  innacurate, while lawyers understand that the low scores result more from an abundance
  of caution than an incapacity of the system to render useful advice. Consequently,
  lawyers are willing to use the legal aid chatbot while non-lawyers avoid it.
