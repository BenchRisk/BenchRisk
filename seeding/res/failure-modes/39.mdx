short: User misunderstands the scope of the benchmark
example: A benchmark advertises itself as measuring "AI creativity" and showcases
  impressive image generation capabilities of a specific SUT. A user, believing this
  benchmark comprehensively assesses all forms of creativity, selects this SUT for
  a natural language generation task requiring creative storytelling. The user is
  then disappointed when the SUT produces bland and unoriginal narratives, realizing
  too late that the benchmark only evaluated visual creativity and provided no insight
  into the model's language generation abilities.
