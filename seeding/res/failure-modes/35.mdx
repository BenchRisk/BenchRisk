short: Failure to propagate uncertainty or confidence from lower level measures to
  higher level grades
example: A benchmark evaluates AI medical diagnosis capabilities across 50 different
  conditions and aggregates these results into a single "Medical Competency Score."
  Each condition assessment has different confidence intervals based on sample size
  and evaluator expertise, but these uncertainties are lost in the final score calculation.
  A particular SUT scores 98% overall due to strong performance on common conditions
  with large sample sizes, masking its poor performance on rare conditions where data
  is limited. The benchmark user implements this system in a rural hospital with different
  disease prevalence patterns than those emphasized in the benchmark. The system consistently
  misdiagnoses several locally common conditions that had wide confidence intervals
  in the original evaluation, leading to inappropriate treatments and delayed correct
  diagnoses for numerous patients before the pattern is recognized.
