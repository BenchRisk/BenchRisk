short: Benchmark authors do not know how to propagate statistical uncertainty into
  a user presentation
example: 'A benchmark reports the performance of several language models on a reading
  comprehension task, providing only single-point accuracy scores (e.g., Model A:
  85%, Model B: 83%). However, the benchmark authors do not know how to conduct sufficient
  evaluations to determine the statistical significance of this 2% difference, nor
  do they present any confidence intervals or other measures of uncertainty. A user
  looking for the most reliable model might incorrectly assume that Model A is definitively
  superior to Model B. In reality, the observed difference could be due to random
  sampling variation, and with more data, the performance of the two models might
  be statistically indistinguishable. The user, lacking information about the uncertainty
  in the benchmark results, makes a potentially suboptimal decision based on a seemingly
  precise but statistically unreliable comparison.'
