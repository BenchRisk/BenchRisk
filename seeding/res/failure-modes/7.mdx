short: Singular prompts without a distributional tie lack a capacity for detecting
  distributional failings, harms, or impacts
example: A benchmark uses only a handful of standalone prompts to test bias in medical
  diagnosis advice. The prompts are about heart attack symptoms in middle-aged men.
  The SUT passes the test. However, when deployed, the SUT systematically fails to
  recognize heart attack symptoms in women and younger patients due to underrepresentation
  in training and evaluation data. The benchmark user deploys the model in a clinical
  triage assistant, and it contributes to misdiagnosis and delayed care for several
  patients outside the narrow demographic tested in the benchmark.
