short: SUT developer trains against sample prompt set
example: A company preparing to release a new model with new capabilities also produces
  a new benchmark to evaluator those capabilities. The organization maintains a separation
  between the benchmark team and the SUT development team, but the benchmark team
  provides a sample test early in the development process. The SUT team then uses
  this released set during training by sampling prompts with similar structure, linguistic
  style, and distribution. As a result, the developer's system performs exceptionally
  well on the benchmark due to fine-tuning on closely aligned prompts. However, the
  model lacks true generalization and performs poorly on tasks that deviate even slightly
  from the benchmark format. The benchmark user interprets the high score as evidence
  of broad competence and deploys the system in a new domain, only to discover critical
  failures when the prompts fall outside the trained distribution.
