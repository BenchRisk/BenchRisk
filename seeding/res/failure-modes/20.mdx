short: Producing prompts in a language from prompts translated from another language
  introduces errors
example: The benchmark tests a model's performance in generating responses in French,
  but the prompts used are initially translated from English using an automatic translation
  tool. These translations introduce subtle idiomatic errors, misinterpretations of
  context, and shifts in tone. As a result, the model is evaluated based on prompts
  that do not fully represent the original intent or phrasing in the source language.
  The benchmark user assumes the model performs well in French but encounters issues
  with unnatural or inaccurate language use when deployed in real-world French-speaking
  contexts, particularly in areas where language nuance is critical.
