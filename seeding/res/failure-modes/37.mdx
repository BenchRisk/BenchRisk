short: User does not read disclaimers
example: A benchmark for conversational AI prominently displays a red-bordered disclaimer
  at the top of its report and executive summary stating that it only evaluates basic
  financial concepts and explicitly warns against using the tested systems for real
  investment advice without professional oversight. Despite this clear warning, a
  financial technology startup focuses solely on the performance metrics and implements
  the highest-scoring SUT as an automated investment advisor. The startup's technical
  team notices but dismisses the disclaimer, assuming their minor customizations will
  address the limitations. They market the system as "benchmark-validated" to clients
  who make significant investment decisions based on the AI's recommendations. When
  market conditions change unexpectedly, the system fails to properly assess risk
  factors it was never benchmarked for, resulting in substantial client losses and
  subsequent lawsuits against the startup for misrepresenting the system's capabilities,
  despite the benchmark authors' clear and prominent warnings.
