short: Data vendor licenses private data that is available to other parties
example: A third-party vendor licenses and a set of complex reasoning prompts without
  ensuring they are the sole organization with a right to license the data. As a result,
  the SUTs may have separately licensed the exact benchmark prompts during training
  or evaluation, inflating their performance and compromising the benchmarkâ€™s validity
  as a measure of generalization or real-world capability. The benchmark user adopts
  the LLM whose developers also licensed the data despite it having poor generalization
  performance.
