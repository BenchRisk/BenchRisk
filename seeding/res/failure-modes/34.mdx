short: Inadequate sample size for identifying performance
example: A benchmark for evaluating toxicity filtering in content moderation systems
  tests each SUT on only 20 prompts designed to elicit harmful content. Due to this
  small sample size, the benchmark fails to capture the true distribution of harmful
  content, edge cases, and adversarial examples. One SUT randomly performs well on
  these specific 20 cases but has serious weaknesses with other toxic content patterns.
  The benchmark user selects this SUT for moderating a large online community platform,
  confident in its high score. Within weeks of deployment, users discover numerous
  ways to bypass the filters, resulting in widespread policy violations, user harassment,
  and significant brand damage before the system's actual limitations are fully understood.
