short: Data vendor provides same prompts to multiple organizations including benchmark
  authors and SUT developers
example: A benchmark uses a proprietary dataset of customer service transcripts licensed
  from a call center vendor. Several major LLM developers also have access to this
  dataset through separate licensing deals, giving them an advantage on the benchmark
  that smaller labs or open-source developers cannot matchâ€”leading to unfair comparisons
  and undermining the benchmark's claims of generalization. Consequently, the benchmark
  user adopts a poor performing system that happened to license all the benchmark
  evaluation data.
