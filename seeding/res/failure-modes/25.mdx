short: SUT developers place evaluator or other test ground truth within system chain
example: During a jailbreak benchmark evaluation, a SUT is configured with access
  to the benchmark's LLM-as-a-judge, which determines whether the outputs of the SUT
  have been jailbroken or not. With access to the LLM-as-a-judge, the LLM scores perfectly
  on the benchmark. However, the LLM-as-a-judge is not perfectly accurate so it obscures
  the true failures of the SUT. A SUT deployer adopts the non-perfect LLM thinking
  it is actually perfect and will not be jailbroken.
