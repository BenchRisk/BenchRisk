short: Prompts have known properties allowing for achieving an unrealistic (i.e.,
  non-generalizing) performance.  For example, prompts are of particular and known
  lengths.
example: A benchmark testing whether code generation models detect instructions for
  generating malware uses prompts that are consistently of a particular length, averaging
  10 lines of code for malware, and 8 lines of code for non-malicious code. The model
  performs well on this benchmark, as it has been explicitly optimized to have a higher
  prior belief of malware for 10 lines of code vs 8 lines of code. However, the difference
  in length is solely a statistical artifact of the evaluation and not representative
  of the actual performance. A benchmark user, assuming the modelâ€™s high score represents
  its ability to prevent malware generation, deploys it in a real-world software development
  environment. The model then generates more malware than would otherwise have been
  generated.
