short: Evaluator(s) have a high false accept rate (unacceptable outputs rated as acceptable)
example: A benchmark employs evaluators to assess AI responses for misinformation
  in scientific explanations. The evaluators, who lack expertise in specialized scientific
  domains, consistently fail to identify subtle but significant inaccuracies in SUT
  outputs, particularly when presented with confident, authoritative-sounding language
  and plausible-seeming explanations. All systems receive artificially high accuracy
  scores, with the most persuasive but factually flawed system scoring highest. The
  benchmark user deploys this system in an educational platform for medical students,
  where it convincingly teaches incorrect mechanisms of drug interactions that go
  undetected for months until graduates apply this misinformation in clinical settings,
  leading to several serious medication errors and a subsequent investigation that
  reveals the systematic flaws in the benchmark's evaluation process.
