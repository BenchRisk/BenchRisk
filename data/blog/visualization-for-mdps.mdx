For our forthcoming paper at the [IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing](https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2015/program) I built a visualization for testing and debugging optimization simulators and algorithms.

The visualization is built on [d3js](http://d3js.org/) and runs in the web browser. If you visit [mdpvis.github.io](http://mdpvis.github.io/) you can interact with a wildfire suppression policy domain. If you have your own MDP domain, you can plug in a MDP simulator URL accessible to your local computer and MDPvis will fetch Monte Carlo rollouts.

Please [contact me](/pages/about.html) if you want your MDP simulator or optimizer listed on the visualization!
