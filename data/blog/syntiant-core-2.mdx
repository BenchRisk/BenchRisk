> Update: my Syntiant Core 2 [presentation](https://youtu.be/uqR2MjucNw4?t=3070) bested Samsung and Qualcomm to win [Best Product at TinyML](https://www.syntiant.com/post/syntiant-ndp120-awarded-best-product-of-the-year-at-tinyml-summit)!

One of my great professional privileges when founding Syntiant's machine
learning stack has been collaborating with a team of electrical engineers
in the design, development, verification, and shipping of an ultra-power
efficient tensor computation core for Syntiant products. Although I
resisted interviewing with Syntiant because I am not an electrical
engineer, the hardware collaboration process we have developed through now
two "Syntiant Cores" has borne fruit after three years of trading between
machine learning requirements and silicon capabilities.
 
I am quite proud of the silicon architecture we developed together and
impressed with the capabilities of my electrical engineering colleagues.
Never did they say to me "it can't be done." I wrote a [marketing post for machine learning engineers](https://www.syntiant.com/news/the-growing-syntiant-core-family) as an introduction of Syntiant's now
two cores.
