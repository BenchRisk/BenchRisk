        In "2001: a Space Odyssey," the astronaut falls into an monolith
        floating in space. Just before the radio cuts transmission to earth, the
        astronaut gasps, "my god, it's full of stars." This sense of wonder and
        impending revelation is the view I brought to my PhD studies in
        artifical intelligence. Surely, I thought, we were working together to
        unwind our own little piece of the great mysteries of the universe. I
        was quickly disabused of my higher notions. In falling into the
        mysteries of intelligence, I came to understand that the intelligence we
        were collectively working to build resembeled the mysterious power of
        the Space Odyssey monolith in more than one way. Only as I fell into my
        research I muttered, "my god, it's full of bugs."
      </p>
      <p>
        This sense of wonder and skepticism left me adrift in a field enraptured
        by its newfound power. Just as the most recent{" "}
        <a href="MyAISummer.html">AI summer</a> was heating up, I was submitting{" "}
        <a href="/pages/vitae.html">papers and giving talks</a> navigating the
        limitations of the current revolution. I approached the field not with
        boundless optimism for the future but with concern for the absence of
        commensurate advances of social systems.

        It is then that I learned Ben Shneiderman was writing a book on
        "Human-Centered AI." At its core, the book looks to reposition the grand
        goal of AI from one in which humans are meant to fall into the pursuit
        of creation, to one in which we are meant to ask ourselves the more
        mundane question of "where is the human in this system?" This
        exceptionally empowering notion is as transformative as it is
        simplistic. The subtle intellectual repositioning moves AI from an
        imposing and unapproachable monolith, to a tool with specific capacities
        and failures that must be carefully applied to the human context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Shneiderman's book is an olive branch from the human side of
        human-centered AI telling the field of machine learning that it has come
        of age and needs to expand its outlook and objectives. We can still
        strive to fall into the stars, but we now need to adopt a more worldly
        perspective in our pursuit of artificial intelligence.
