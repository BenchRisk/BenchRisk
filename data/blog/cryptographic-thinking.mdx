Advocates for a national DNA identity database won a major victory with
the Supreme Court’s [recent decision](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/us/supreme-court-says-police-can-take-dna-samples.html?_r=0) to permit the routine collection
and storage of DNA data. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the
majority,

> When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee’s DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.”

Finger prints are a person’s unique identifier. When your finger prints
are entered into a database, they will only serve to identify you. DNA
has very different properties from fingerprints since DNA is a
“biological social network.” You can tell with fairly high precision
when an unknown sample is related to someone in the database.

For example, if your cousin’s DNA is in the DNA database, then leaving
an eyelash somewhere will lead to you very quickly. Given the number of
people who move through the criminal justice system, it is unlikely that
your family will not be in the database, so it amounts to a national
registry. The dissenting opinions in the Supreme Court case see this
property of DNA (among other issues) as an affront to the fourth
amendment.

One solution not being discussed in the media is an algorithm that would
maintain DNA database’s usefulness for matching criminals to their DNA
*already in* the database, but would destroy the ability for the
database to find familial ties. Basically, you can construct a function
(a cryptographic hash), that allows you to match crime scene DNA to
records in the database without actually storing a record of DNA.

It would be useful for our fourth amendment rights if legislators knew
of basic privacy-preserving technologies. It is often possible to
investigate crimes without needing to compromise the privacy of the
entire populace if only we think about solutions instead of tradeoffs.
