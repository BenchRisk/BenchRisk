My latest blog post appeared on O’Reilly Media’s programming blog.

> Recent work by a [W3 Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/) plans to expose many powerful
> cryptographic operations for web applications. Although the planned
> API adds much needed functionality to JavaScript, it doesn’t address
> the JavaScript runtime’s terrible security properties. For instance,
> any script running in the web application has the power to hijack
> the web app’s content and UX. Just last February a mistake in
> Facebook’s "like" button [brought down millions of web sites](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/facebook-glitch-takes-down-countless-major-websites).
> Further, if you are an online service provider wanting to support
> higher privacy use cases like encrypted chat or web-based PGP email,
> the trust model is [fundamentally broken](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/20/hushmail_update/) since you can’t serve
> cryptographic JavaScript code without making the server a potential
> attack point.


> The security challenges faced by JavaScript are mitigated by Privly,
> also labeled “the Web Privacy Stack,” by addressing two issues: (1)
> scoping code to the data, and (2) pre-distributing the code to the
> clients when possible.
