The [Safety Critical Expert Group](https://www.partnershiponai.org/sc-wg-launch/) brings together representatives from AI industrial organizations with persons from civil society organizations to address developing issues in AI safety. I serve as co-chair with [Ashish Kapoor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/akapoor/) and
[Amanda Askell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-askell-1ab457175). My passion project within the working group is a database cataloging where intelligent systems have produced harms within the world.
