I was an organizer for the [NeurIPS Workshop](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/Schedule?showEvent=10904) [focusing](https://aiforsocialgood.github.io/2018/index.htm) on social problems for which artificial intelligence has the potential to offer meaningful solutions. I additionally moderated the [panel](https://aiforsocialgood.github.io/2018/schedule.htm) on "Academia, Corporations, Society, Responsibility", with Zoubin Ghahramani (Uber), David Danks (CMU), Lisa Di Jorio (Imagia), and Julien Cornebise (Element AI).

The workshop reach a peak attendance of more than 700 people during the lunchtime demonstration from acclaimed cellist Yo Yo Ma.
