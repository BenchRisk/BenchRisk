In 2019 the Neural Information Processing Systems conference added a peer-reviewed \"socials track.\" The idea was to bring the social life of the conference back from sprawling corporate parties to gatherings organized by and for the research community. In this social event I submitted an abstract describing the event with my colleagues at the XPRIZE Foundation, then [hosted a gathering](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?showEvent=15963) attended to capacity.
