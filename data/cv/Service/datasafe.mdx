I served on the program committee for this AAAI workshop focused on data-centric AI safety. Details can be found on the [workshop website](https://sites.google.com/view/datasafe25/home).

From the workshop website:
`This workshop welcomes contributions towards creation and improvement of datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation of safety of AI systems (in particular LLMs) according to the characteristics listed above. The work can be theoretical (new approaches to creating datasets or proving a dataset's adequacy for the task) or practical (suggesting new datasets, checking the validity of existing datasets, improving existing datasets). We also welcome contributions that use existing benchmarks to demonstrate safety or AI systems or find unsafe behaviours.`
