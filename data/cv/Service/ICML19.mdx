I was an organizer for the [ICML Workshop](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/ScheduleMultitrack?event=3505) focusing on social problems for which artificial intelligence has the potential to offer meaningful solutions. The organizing group shares responsibilities for chairing the review, schedule, and other event tasks.
