I was an organizer for the [ICLR Workshop](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?showEvent=637) focusing on social problems for which artificial intelligence has the potential to offer meaningful solutions. The organizing group shares responsibilities for chairing the review, schedule, and other event tasks.

You can find [videos from the event](https://slideslive.com/iclr/iclr-2019-r05-ai-for-social-good) on Slideshare.
