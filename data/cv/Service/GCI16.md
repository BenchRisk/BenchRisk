title: Mentor, Google Code In
year: 2016

I mentored students through the FOSSASIA mentoring organization in the [2016 Google Code In](https://codein.withgoogle.com/), a "...global, online contest introducing teenagers to the world of open source development" with variety of bite-sized tasks. My responsibility was to help students accomplish a variety of tasks advancing their skills and understanding of open source development. Mentoring for this program is both inspiring and tremendously valuable for developing cultural insights. Teenagers from around the world typically have not developed an international style of professional work so you see unfiltered communication and help develop a professional sense.
