GSoC, or Google Summer of Code, is an annual program sponsored by Google. It offers stipends to university students for working on open-source projects during the summer. The aim is to encourage students to get involved in open-source software development, contribute to real-world projects, and gain valuable coding experience. The program is highly competitive for applicant organizations and students to those organizations. Many of the students who have participated in the program have gone on to high level positions in industry, startups, and research.

My role in the program was as both an organization administrator for the Privly Foundation (which I founded), and as a mentor for several student projects over the course of the foundation's three years of participation.
