The OECD is an intergovernmental organization with 38 member countries, founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade.
One of their more recent successes was the creation of a [Global portal on product recalls](https://globalrecalls.oecd.org/#/). Seeing
an opportunity to similarly advance product safety within the artificial intelligence industry, the OECD became interested in how
it could learn from the [AI Incident Database](https://incidentdatabase.ai/) -- a project I had previously initiated.

As part of my [service](https://oecd.ai/en/community/sean-mcgregor), I have been giving comment to various policy documents under production at OECD and have presented to the expert
group at several junctures.

I am quite proud to see how the small side project I started 6+ years ago is having an impact in the development of intergovernmental policy.
