ML Commons is an open engineering consortium with participation from leading industry and academic artificial intelligence labs.
While in industry, I submitted to the ML Commons tiny ML benchmarks [(example result for the processor I helped develop)](https://www.syntiant.com/news/syntiant-core-2-achieves-outstanding-results-in-latest-mlperf-tiny-v1-1-benchmark-suite).
I subsequently worked within the ML Commons [AI Risk and Reliability](https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/airr/ai-risk-and-reliability/)
working group as co-chair of the Integrity and Reliability workstream. Our work is to characterize highly reliable large language model (LLM) benchmarks so that they could be used by people making real world decisions (e.g., "which of these are safer? and for what purposes?").
