title: Steward, Coalition of Graduate Employees

The Coalition of Graduate Employees (CGE) is a labor union representing more than 1,600 graduate employees. During my time in graduate school I helped double the size of the bargaining unit and budget, bargain a multi-million dollar contract, collaborate with university human resources on the implementation of our health plan, serve as ranking member of our delegation to the state federation, and serve as secretary-treasurer.
