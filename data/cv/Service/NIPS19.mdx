I was an organizer for the [NeurIPS Workshop](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?showEvent=13170) [focusing](https://aiforsocialgood.github.io/neurips2019/) on social problems for which artificial intelligence has the potential to offer meaningful solutions. I worked to broaden the scope of the workshop from the prior iterations and include elements of producing good, characterizing bad, and policy for maximizing the former while minimizing the later.
