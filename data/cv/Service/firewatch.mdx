Through time, wildfires become exponentially more difficult to suppress. Detecting fire and dispatching crews to their suppression is thus time critical.
During red flag events (i.e., dry high winds) in Southern California, I assist local authorities as a fire spotter. I have a hi-vi vest and everything. :)
