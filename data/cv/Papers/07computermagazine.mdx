This publication gives the complete rundown of the AI XPRIZE from start to finish. I was the lead technical consultant on the prize.

**Abstract**

> The IBM Watson AI XPRIZE was a $5 million competition calling for teams to improve the world for "good" with artificial intelligence. Competing over positive social progress rather than technological progress required innovation in qualitative judging processes that produced the most extensive evaluation of AI system impacts performed to date. Over the course of four years, more than 150 teams were evaluated for their impacts and responsible engineering for social change. This work presents the responsible AI processes developed for the prize, including solutions for judging absolute and relative impacts with (1) a forced ranking method to produce efficient consensus of review panels, (2) a "red judge" process of domain experts supporting the review panels, and (3) an algorithm and user interface for collaborative ranking. Collectively, these developments represent the most comprehensive and scaled impact evaluation of intelligent systems yet conducted.
