This work extends [Model-Free Monte Carlo](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v9/fonteneau10a/fonteneau10a.pdf) to large state space Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by factoring the state space. We successfully generate surrogate trajectories for a large state space MDP (more than 10^1000000 states) with 8 state features. We posted an extended version of the paper to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09390).
