This paper is the first application of random forests for direct policy search. Additionally, it is the first case of optimizing wildfire suppression policies across 100 year time spans. This is a standalone version of the paper incorporated into the book chapter, "Connecting Conservation Research and Implementation: Building a Wildfire Assistant."
