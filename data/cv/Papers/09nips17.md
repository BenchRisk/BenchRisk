This workshop paper and poster introduce the work product of the 2017 NASA Frontier Development Lab (FDL) research team in space weather prediction. We modeled solar activity with deep neural networks to predict solar flares. [FlareNet](http://github.com/nasa-fdl/flarenet) shows promise in predicting natural phenomena that can cause immense damage to human terrestrial infrastructure.
