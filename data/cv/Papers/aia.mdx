**Abstract**

> System labels analogous to nutrition and drug labels can compactly present safety properties to users, but the absence of clear methodologies for populating the labels of adaptive AI systems leaves many users guessing what are safe applications of the systems. In this abstract we present an approach to standardizing the production of safety labels through safety test automation.
