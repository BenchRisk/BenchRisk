We brought Allen Institute for AI's Open Language Model (OLMo) and their gaurd model, WildGuard, to the annual hackers conference DEF CON.
I had the pleasure of taunting a room of hackers with a declaration that OLMo is flawless and adjudicated over the course of the conference
evidence of where it failed to live up to such lofty and unachievable ambitions.

**Abstract**

> In August of 2024, 495 hackers generated evaluations in an open-ended bug bounty targeting the Open Language Model (OLMo) from The Allen Institute for AI. A vendor panel staffed by representatives of OLMo's safety program adjudicated changes to OLMo's documentation and awarded cash bounties to participants who successfully demonstrated a need for public disclosure clarifying the intent, capacities, and hazards of model deployment. This paper presents a collection of lessons learned, illustrative of flaw reporting best practices intended to reduce the likelihood of incidents and produce safer large language models (LLMs). These include best practices for safety reporting processes, their artifacts, and safety program staffing.
