This is essentially a manifesto, published in Computer Magazine, outlining the importance of safety data for machine learning applications.

**Abstract**

> This work makes the argument for elevating “safety data” as a class of obliged-to-share open data among intelligent system vendors so developers of digital systems can produce safer systems without independently producing repeated harms.
