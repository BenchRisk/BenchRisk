I keynoted the [Thrival Innovation Festival](http://www.thrivalfestival.com/2017-programs-schedule/) on the topic of Artificial Intelligence for good. This talk was to a general business and startup audience and centered around the teams competing in the IBM Watson AI XPRIZE. Following the keynote I sat on a panel with David Danks (CMU Philosophy department chair), Amrit Dhir (Google for Entrepreneurs), Jana Eggers (Nara Logics), and Iba Masood (TARA.AI).
