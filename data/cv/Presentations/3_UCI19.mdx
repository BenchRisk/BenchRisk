**Abstract:** Over the last half century, the field of software
engineering has produced tools and techniques for efficiently
developing software. Some examples include unit/integration testing,
integrated development environments, formal verification methods, and
more. More recent machine-learned or "intelligent systems" pose
distinctive challenges that are poorly served by these existing
software engineering tools and techniques. This talk will cover the
elements making intelligent system engineering distinctive from
traditional software engineering and highlight tools and techniques
tailored to the engineering challenges they introduce. This topic will
be explored in the context of several motivating examples, including
the development of a "production grade" speech recognition model at
Syntiant, a system for making recommendations in response to
wildfires, and collaborative work at the Partnership on AI.
