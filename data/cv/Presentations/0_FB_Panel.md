As part of my service on the Partnership on AI's [AI and Media Integrity Steering Committee](https://www.partnershiponai.org/ai-and-media-integrity-steering-committee/), I sat on a [panel](https://dfdclaunchevent.splashthat.com/) for the launch of Facebook's [Deepfake Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/overview). The panel focused on the importance of the deepfake detection problem and how we can mitigate the immediate impacts through the development of detector models. The central premise I presented to the panel was that we can build detector models for the current generation of deepfakes, but these detectors are brittle and will fail to detect with each generation of improved deepfake generator models. See my discussion of the topic [here](https://seanbmcgregor.com/DeepfakeDetectionGame.html).
