> Mature industrial sectors (e.g., aviation) collect their real world failures in incident databases to improve design and process, but the AI industry lacks similar systematization. As a result, companies repeatedly make the same mistakes in the design, development, and deployment of intelligent systems. The AI Incident Database (AIID) is the start of formal record keeping of AI harms realized in the real world. The AIID dataset highlights several issues in human-machine collaboration through an analytic web front end for more than 1,000 incident reports archived to date. Insights from the project's data and collaboration architecture will be presented.
