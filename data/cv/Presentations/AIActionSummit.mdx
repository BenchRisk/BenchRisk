In this presentation I gave a short talk introducing the Benchmarks' Benchmark, which scores Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks according to how reliably they inform decision makers about the properties of the tested LLMs. This was a "Business Day" event of the AI Action Summit, which was a global convening centered on AI policy and cooperation.
