[This presentation](https://nips.cc/Expo/Conferences/2018/Schedule?talk_id=26) surveyed recent results and organizational directions in the AI for Good space. My contribution to the presentation was to introduce a few examples of teams within the IBM Watson AI XPRIZE and to give the attendees an outline of the conference proceedings for which "AI for Good" is an explicit or implicit topic. I was later invited to reprise elements of the presentation at the [Common Model Infrastructure](https://nips.cc/Expo/Conferences/2018/Schedule?workshop_id=4) Expo Workshop organized by Baidu.
