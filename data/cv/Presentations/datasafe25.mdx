**Workshop Description**

This workshop centered on the creation and improvement of datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation of safety of AI systems (in particular LLMs). The work presented included theoretical (new approaches to creating datasets or proving a dataset's adequacy for the task) and practical approaches (suggesting new datasets, checking the validity of existing datasets, improving existing datasets).

**Panel Description**

This panel addressed safety concerns related to agentic AI systems, focusing on autonomy, trustworthiness, drift, and transparency. The discussion aimed to identify emerging risks and point toward potential innovative solutions.

**Moderator**

* Prof. Elena Simperl - King's College London

**Panelists**

* Dr. Angelo Dalli - Chief Scientist and Co-Founder, UMNAI
* Rajat Ghosh - Staff Data Scientist, Nutanix
* Prof. Gopal Ramchurn - Professor of Artificial Intelligence, University of Southampton
* Srija Chakraborty - Scientist, Universities Space Research Association (USRA)
* Dr. Sean McGregor - Founding Director, Digital Safety Research Institute at the UL Research Institutes
