I spent the summer of 2017 working collaboratively with computer scientists and heliophysicists to predict solar flares from raw [Solar Dynamics Observatory](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) images. This presentation was an [invited talk]((https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/events/machinelearningworkshop2017/agenda/)) to present our preliminary results to the NASA community.

My contributions to this research included defining the software architecture for heliophysics deep learning research, including visualization methods for extracting scientific insights from trained neural network models.

Since the development process was unusual by NASA standards, the first quarter of the presentation focused on our style of agile development methods as a means of conducting interdisciplinary research.
