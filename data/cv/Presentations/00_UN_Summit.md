I served as [panelist and/or rapporteur](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/AI/Pages/201706-programme.aspx) for this gathering of UN Agencies, NGOs, and academics. The group effort centered on developing guidlines and principles for the beneficial use of Artificial Intelligence. As part of my panel participation I drafted three documents in collaboration with panel moderators. These include one document on beneficial AI with the head of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA), another document on privacy and security with the director of the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, and a final document on measuring the positive and negative impacts of AI technologies with the head of UNICEF's venture fund.
