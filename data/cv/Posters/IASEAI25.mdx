**Venue**

This was the innaugeral invitation-only meeting of the International Association for Safe and Ethical AI in Paris immediately preceeding the [AI Action Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_Action_Summit). I presented ongoing work scoring LLM benchmarks according to their reliability.

**Abstract**

`LLM benchmarks advance model capabilities, but benchmarks produced for optimization purposes are not designed to inform real world decisions (e.g., answer "am I safe to do <task> with this LLM?"). In serving a development and/or research purpose, optimization benchmarks suffer from a collection of "threats to reliability" that lead benchmark developers to disclaim their real world reliability. In contrast, ML Commons released its "AILuminate" benchmark in December to evidence real world safety (or lack thereof). Serving real world decision making required developing new techniques and organizational practices not generally required for optimization benchmarks (e.g., secret evaluator models and ensuring sole ownership and control of the evaluation data). This work captures those practices in the form of a new benchmark of benchmarks (B2) that serves to identify more reliable real world decision benchmarks. B2 was produced by observing and recording threats to reliability that arose during the production of AILuminate. Points are scored by affirming adoption of mitigations. Both the threat and mitigation lists are stewarded by the independent safety organization, UL Research Institutes, which is now expanding the list of threats and their candidate mitigations with additional benchmarks.`
