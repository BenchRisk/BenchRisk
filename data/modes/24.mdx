short: SUT is tested under conditions (e.g. temperature, iteration, context window
  settings) not matching deployment conditions or those conditions typically experienced
  by relying persons under default configurations
example: 'The benchmark evaluates a system under optimal settingsâ€”low temperature
  for deterministic outputs, extended context windows, and multiple-shot prompting
  with carefully selected exemplars. However, real-world users typically interact
  with the system using default settings: higher temperature, single-shot prompts,
  and shorter contexts due to latency or cost constraints. As a result, the model''s
  benchmark performance significantly overstates its real-world reliability and quality.
  A benchmark user assumes the model''s benchmark score reflects the default configuration,
  deploys it in a customer-facing chatbot, and receives inconsistent, low-quality
  responses that degrade user trust and satisfaction.'
