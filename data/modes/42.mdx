short: SUT developer trains SUT against sample set
example: A benchmark releases a subset of its prompts for transparency and community
  analysis. A system developer then uses this released set during training by sampling
  prompts with similar structure, linguistic style, and distribution. As a result,
  the developer's system performs exceptionally well on the benchmark due to fine-tuning
  on closely aligned prompts. However, the model lacks true generalization and performs
  poorly on tasks that deviate even slightly from the benchmark format. The benchmark
  user interprets the high score as evidence of broad competence and deploys the system
  in a new domain, only to discover critical failures when the prompts fall outside
  the trained distribution.
