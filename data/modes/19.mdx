short: Cultural norms do not translate between cultural contexts (languages, geographies,
  etc.)
example: The benchmark tests a language modelâ€™s ability to understand and generate
  appropriate responses to cultural references in a variety of languages. However,
  the evaluation is conducted primarily in English, using Western cultural norms and
  references. When the model is deployed in a different geographic or linguistic context,
  such as in Japan or Brazil, it fails to understand or appropriately respond to culturally
  specific references, phrases, and social nuances, leading to misunderstandings and
  alienation in non-Western audiences. The benchmark user assumes the model is universally
  adept at handling cultural nuances but encounters failures in real-world deployments
  across different regions.
