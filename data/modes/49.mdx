short: SUT developer trains against evaluation set
example: The developers of "InsightfulBot" develop a new question-answering benchmark.
  They then intentionally fine-tune InsightfulBot specifically on the exact questions
  and answers of the benchmark, optimizing performance on the metrics without improving
  its ability to generalize to novel queries it hasn't seen before. A user, impressed
  by InsightfulBot's top-ranking score on the benchmark as posted on HuggingFace,
  assumes it possesses superior knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, when
  they use InsightfulBot for real-world information retrieval with unseen questions,
  the model performs poorly, demonstrating that its benchmark success was an artifact
  of overfitting to the evaluation data rather than genuine intelligence.
