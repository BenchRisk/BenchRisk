short: User does not understand visual representation of scores
example: benchmark presents model performance results using a sophisticated radar
  chart with multiple axes representing different capabilities, where larger area
  indicates better overall performance. The chart uses inverted scales for some metrics
  where lower values are better (like error rates), but doesn't clearly label this
  inversion. A company's CTO misinterprets the visualization, believing that a particular
  SUT excels in every dimension when in fact it performs poorly on critical safety
  metrics where the scale was inverted. Based on this misunderstanding, they deploy
  this model for sensitive customer service automation, only discovering their error
  when the system begins generating inappropriate responses to difficult customer
  inquiries. By the time they correct their misunderstanding and replace the system,
  they've already lost several major clients and faced public criticism for their
  irresponsible AI deployment.
