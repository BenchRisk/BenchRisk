short: User behavior shifts through time
example: A benchmark initially tests a language model's ability to answer factual
  questions about world history. Early users find the benchmark helpful in identifying
  models that are capable tutors of history. However, as time passes, user behavior
  evolves. They start using language models for new history classes with more comprehensive
  coverage of history in Asia and Africa, areas the original benchmark did not assess.
  Consequently, a user relying solely on the initial benchmark scores might select
  a model that excels at American or European history but performs poorly the expanded
  considerations of world history.
