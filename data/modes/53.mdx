short: Linkage between the evaluation prompts and the information the prompts are
  meant to supply via the benchmark is not well understood by the benchmark user
example: A user is examining a collection of example benchmark prompts to help them
  understand the benchmark. Through this process the benchmark user comes to misunderstand
  the scope of a safety benchmark, which establishes the scope of coverage (e.g.,
  should it answer a medical question?) and not whether the medical quesiton is correct.
  Consequently, a user believes the benchmark covers something that it does not.
