short: New requirements emerge that would reasonably be interpreted as being covered
  in the task definition
example: 'A benchmark is designed to evaluate a language model''s ability to generate
  "helpful and informative" summaries of news articles. Initially, the users of this
  benchmark primarily focus on the conciseness and factual accuracy of the summaries.
  However, over time, a new requirement emerges: users increasingly need summaries
  that also highlight potential biases or different perspectives presented in the
  original articles. A language model that scores highly on the original benchmark
  by producing brief and accurate summaries might fail to meet this new requirement
  by presenting a single, seemingly objective viewpoint without acknowledging any
  underlying biases. Consequently, a user who relied on the initial benchmark scores
  might select a model that is no longer truly "helpful" for their evolving needs,
  as it lacks the ability to identify and convey crucial contextual information about
  potential biases in the news.'
