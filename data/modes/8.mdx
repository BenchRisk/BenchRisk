short: Prompt writers produce prompts with inadequate variability within the valid
  input space (e.g., a single prompt writer writes all the prompts)
example: A benchmark designed to test reasoning over legal contracts uses 500 prompts,
  all written by a single legal expert. Although the expert is highly knowledgeable,
  their prompts all follow similar structures, phrasings, and assumptions. As a result,
  the SUT learns to pick up on these patterns and performs well. However, when deployed
  to assist general counsel teams, the model fails to handle real-world contract analysis
  tasks that involve diverse linguistic styles, jurisdictions, and edge cases. The
  benchmark user trusts the high benchmark score and integrates the model into a high-stakes
  legal review process, leading to costly misinterpretations.
