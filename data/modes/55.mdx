short: A SUT developer has disparate access to information about the benchmark **after**
  its release (i.e., information not provided to other SUT developers)
example: The creators of a challenging reasoning benchmark privately share detailed
  information about the specific types of logical fallacies and linguistic ambiguities
  that the benchmark questions are designed to test with the developers of "CognitoMind"
  weeks after the official public release. Other SUT developers are only provided
  with the high-level task description at the time of launch. This privileged information
  allows the CognitoMind team to specifically tailor their model's architecture and
  training data to excel on these known weaknesses of other models. As a result, CognitoMind
  achieves a significantly higher score on the benchmark, not due to superior general
  reasoning capabilities, but because they had an unfair advantage in understanding
  the benchmark's intricacies. A benchmark user, unaware of this information asymmetry,
  might mistakenly conclude that CognitoMind is the most advanced reasoning engine
  available and choose it for critical applications, only to find its performance
  on real-world reasoning tasks (that don't align with the benchmark's specific design)
  is underwhelming compared to other models.
