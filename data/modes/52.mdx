short: Benchmark production failed to account for an idiosyncratic failure mode
example: A benchmark developer failed to read a recent research paper listing common
  failure modes and potential mitigations. As a result, the benchmark authors fail
  to publish integrity requirements at the time their benchmark is published. Subsequently,
  a SUT developer trains to the benchmark's sample set and overperforms relative to
  its actual performance. Consequently, a user adopts what would ordinarily be known
  as a poor performing SUT.
