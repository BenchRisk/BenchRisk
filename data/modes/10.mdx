short: Prompt perturbation bulking (increasing the number of prompts by making small
  changes to root prompts)
example: A benchmark aimed at evaluating factual accuracy in historical QA uses 100
  base prompts and generates 5,000 total prompts by slightly altering dates, names,
  or phrasing (e.g., changing “When did the Berlin Wall fall?” to “Can you tell me
  the year the Berlin Wall was taken down?”). While the quantity of prompts appears
  large, the semantic diversity is minimal and fails to cover the broader landscape
  of historical questions. A model optimized on this benchmark appears highly performant,
  but when users ask genuinely diverse or nuanced historical questions, it frequently
  hallucinates or misinterprets. The benchmark user integrates the model into an educational
  tool, leading to the dissemination of confidently stated misinformation.
