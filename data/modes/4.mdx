short: Prompts are collected from publicly available sources that are also likely
  to be in the datasets of SUT developers
example: The benchmark uses Reddit posts, StackOverflow questions, and Quora queries
  to construct prompts. Since these sources are commonly included in pretraining corpora,
  models like GPT or Claude that have seen these prompts during training score significantly
  higher than models trained on different data distributions, leading to misleadingly
  inflated performance. The benchmark user never considers using a SUT not pre-trained
  with these sources as a result.
