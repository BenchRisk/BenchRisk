short: Presentation without uncertainty or confidence of the scores
example: A benchmark report presents a single numerical "Stock Trading Ability" score
  each SUT without any indication of statistical uncertainty, variance across test
  cases, or confidence intervals for the presented scores. The published results show
  two systems scoring 57% and 55% respectively, implying the first system is superior.
  The benchmark user selects the marginally higher-scoring system and implements it
  for critical financial analysis. In reality, the scores had overlapping confidence
  intervals (Â± 10%) and the supposedly "better" system is materially worse when subject
  to additional scrutiny. The organization discovers this only after several months
  of operation when market competitors deploying the other model places the company
  on the bad end of several multi-million dollar trades.
