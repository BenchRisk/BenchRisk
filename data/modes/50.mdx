short: SUT developer trains against evaluation set after benchmark release
example: The developers of "InsightfulBot" gain access to the full evaluation set
  of a prominent question-answering benchmark. They then intentionally fine-tune their
  model specifically on these exact questions and answers, optimizing its performance
  on the benchmark metrics without improving its ability to generalize to novel queries
  it hasn't seen before. A user, impressed by InsightfulBot's top-ranking score on
  the benchmark, assumes it possesses superior knowledge and reasoning capabilities.
  However, when they use InsightfulBot for real-world information retrieval with unseen
  questions, the model performs poorly, demonstrating that its benchmark success was
  an artifact of overfitting to the evaluation data rather than genuine intelligence.
