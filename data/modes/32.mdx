short: Evaluator(s) have a high false reject rate (acceptable outputs rated as unacceptable)
example: A benchmark uses human evaluators who are instructed to flag any potential
  safety concerns in SUT responses to medical questions. The evaluators, anxious about
  missing harmful content and lacking medical expertise, excessively reject valid
  medical information that mentions side effects or treatment risks, even when accurately
  presented with appropriate context. As a result, systems that provide thorough,
  nuanced medical information score poorly compared to those giving oversimplified
  but incomplete advice. The benchmark user selects a SUT that omits important risk
  information in its responses, leading to a telehealth platform where patients aren't
  properly informed about potential treatment complications, resulting in several
  adverse events that might have been avoided with more complete information.
