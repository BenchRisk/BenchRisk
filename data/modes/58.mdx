short: Understanding the benchmark requires more resources (e.g., study, expertise,
  exploration) than the relying user has time to expend
example: A benchmark evaluates the nuanced safety profiles of large language models
  across a battery of complex, multi-turn adversarial prompts, utilizing sophisticated
  statistical analyses and presenting the results across a dozen different sub-scores
  and visualizations. The accompanying documentation is extensive and filled with
  technical jargon requiring a background in natural language processing and safety
  research to fully comprehend. A busy software engineer looking to quickly select
  a reasonably safe LLM for their application lacks the time and specialized knowledge
  to thoroughly study the benchmark methodology, interpret the various scores, and
  understand their implications for real-world deployment. They might then resort
  to simply looking at an overall "safety ranking" (if provided, and potentially misleadingly
  aggregated) or choose a model based on incomplete or superficial understanding of
  the benchmark results, potentially selecting a model that isn't actually the most
  suitable for their specific safety requirements.
