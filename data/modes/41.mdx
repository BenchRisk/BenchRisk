short: SUT developer tunes safety program to benchmark sample set
example: A benchmark releases a subset of its prompts for transparency and community
  analysis. A system developer then uses this released set during training by sampling
  its prompts directly. As a result, the developer's system performs exceptionally
  well on the benchmark due to closely aligned fine-tuning. However, the model lacks
  true generalization and performs poorly on tasks that deviate even slightly from
  the benchmark format. The benchmark user interprets the high score as evidence of
  broad competence and deploys the system in a new domain, only to discover critical
  failures when the prompts fall outside the trained distribution.
