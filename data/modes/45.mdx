short: SUT developers update the SUT without changing the name or version of the SUT
example: A benchmark evaluates "Model X" in January 2025 and publishes its results.
  Several months later, the developers of "Model X" release a significantly improved
  version of the model with architectural changes and updated training data, but they
  still refer to it as "Model X" without any version number change. A user consulting
  the benchmark results from January assumes the current "Model X" has the same capabilities
  and limitations as the one tested previously and fail to switch over to a new and
  better model.
