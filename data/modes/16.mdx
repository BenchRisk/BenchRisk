short: An inadequate number of prompts are produced to identify rare critical events
  (i.e., tail risks)
example: A benchmark designed to evaluate a model's ability to detect financial fraud
  runs 500 prompts, including several fraud scenarios that must be detected with very
  high probability, such as coordinated international money laundering. However, the
  number of prompts focusing on these rare, high-impact events is too small to reliably
  determine when a system drops below the required 99.9 percent detection rate. As
  a result, most models pass the benchmark with a high score. The benchmark user assumes
  a passing model is meets requirements and deploys it, overlooking the fact that
  the benchmark may not detect coordinated money laundering at a sufficient rate.
