short: The benchmark does not measure a property of the SUT linked to the user task
example: A benchmark rigorously evaluates the toxicity levels of a language model's
  responses, aiming to ensure it avoids generating hateful or offensive content. A
  user, however, is primarily concerned with whether the model exhibits kindness and
  empathy in its interactions, wanting it to provide supportive and understanding
  responses. They choose the model with the lowest toxicity score, assuming that a
  non-toxic model will automatically be kind and empathetic. However, they discover
  that the chosen model, while successfully avoiding harmful language, produces bland,
  emotionally neutral, and unhelpful responses that lack any genuine sense of care
  or consideration for the user's emotional state. The benchmark, by focusing solely
  on the absence of toxicity, failed to assess the positive qualities of kindness
  and empathy that were crucial for the user's desired application.
